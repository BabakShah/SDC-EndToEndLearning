# Self-Driving Car Project: End-to-End Learning

Hello there! I'm Babak. Let me introduce you to my project. In this project I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a three
front-facing cameras (left, center, right) directly to steering commands. This end-to-end approach
proved surprisingly powerful method to teach the self-driving car drive without explicitly training the car to detect, for example, the outline
of roads. This project was written using Python object oriented programming.
